            <h2>Howd does Quidditch work?</h2>
            <p>
                Quidditch is a thrilling sport played in the wizarding world on flying broomsticks. Each team consists of seven players divided into specific roles:

                Chasers (3 players): Their goal is to score points by throwing the Quaffle through one of the three goal hoops, earning 10 points for each goal.
                
                Beaters (2 players): They protect their teammates from Bludgers, which are rogue balls that try to knock players off their brooms. Beaters use bats to hit the Bludgers away from their team.
                
                Keeper (1 player): The Keeper guards the goal hoops and attempts to block opposing Chasers from scoring.
                
                Seeker (1 player): The Seekerâ€™s primary responsibility is to catch the Golden Snitch, a small, fast-moving ball worth 150 points. Catching the Snitch also ends the game.
                
                The Balls
                Quaffle: The red ball used by Chasers to score goals.
                Bludgers: Two black balls that fly around, targeting players. Beaters hit them away from their team.
                Golden Snitch: A tiny, winged ball that is difficult to catch, crucial for concluding the match.
                Scoring and Duration
                Matches can last for hours or even days, as there is no set time limit. The game continues until the Snitch is caught, which typically ends the match and awards the Seeker's team an additional 150 points.
                
                Spectators
                Quidditch matches draw large crowds of passionate fans, creating an electric atmosphere filled with excitement and team spirit.
